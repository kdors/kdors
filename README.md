### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kdors

You can call me Kennedy. 

Iâ€™m a biostatistics master's student, and Iâ€™m interested in **statistics/statistical programming**, **machine learning**, and **software development**. I hope to
populate my Github with what I'm learning ~~to hold myself accountable~~ to showcase some interesting things I learn along the way!


You can reach me at my LinkedIn [here](https://linkedin.com/in/kennedydorsey/).
